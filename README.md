# MGBDesign
A repository of design values for MGB

This system is designed to allow "Massive Galaxy Battles" (name pending) to read it's design 
values from an external, easily updatable source.  This will allow rapid iteration on the
finicky game rules, without having to recompile, redepeloy, and replay the game from the
beginning.
